Easy Computer Vision is an open source framework (part of OpenSourceSearch.com University's "Easy" series), built around Mask R CNN algorithm. It is designed for those who would like to be able to tain their own machine learning models for image/video recognition, but do not know or want to code their own training pipeline. Easy Computer Vision hides all complexity under it's hood and provides a very detailed documentation, making it possible for everyone to get involved training their models for computer vision. It supports prediction against image, directory of images, video file and live video stream as inputs.
